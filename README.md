# Roland J-6 Project Refactor

## Overview

This project focuses on refactoring an application initially developed with significant contributions from AI-generated code. The primary objectives were to enhance code quality by removing unnecessary or duplicate code, improving organization, and increasing overall readability.

## Goals

- **Code Cleanup**: Identified and eliminated redundant code segments to streamline functionality.
- **Improved Organization**: Restructured the codebase for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Implemented consistent naming conventions and documentation to make the code easier to understand for future developers.

## Approach

1. **Code Analysis**: Conducted a thorough review of the existing codebase to identify areas for improvement.
2. **Refactoring**: Applied refactoring techniques to simplify complex functions and reduce duplication.
3. **Documentation**: Updated comments and added documentation to clarify code functionality and usage.

## Results

The refactored application is now more efficient, easier to maintain, and accessible for future development. This project not only improved the current codebase but also established best practices for ongoing development.

## Notes

I have only included the initial project app/components files, in addition to the files that I created for refactoring so this project cannot be installed.
